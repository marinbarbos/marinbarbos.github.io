            <hr/>
            <p>I am a student at UNESP Rio Claro, working on a Bachelor of Computer Science.
                Fluent in english with basic spanish.</p>
            <p>My interests in the area are diverse since I like to study and experiment with different tech
                as a way to not limit myself. At the moment I'm studying Java, Python and Kotlin deeper, since 
                I have many personal projects which i believe these languages are suitable for. I hope to 
                soon include these projects in this page, as well as making it a better experience to visit!</p>
            <p>My course completion work of the Information technology technical course was related to
                microcontrollers and automation, the idea was developing a simple control and maintenance system 
                in hydroponic "blocks", to allow for expandable food production with low manual interference.
                The physical system did not have deep developments in the time period allowed, but the 
                research done on hydroponic systems and microcontrollers had great development, which granted me 
                a great knowledge base on these subjects and in research.</p>
            <p>I have professional experience with multiple microcontrollers, worked briefly with automotive
                automation, bluetooth connection, electronics and user interface development.</p>
